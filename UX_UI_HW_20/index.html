          <h2>PHASE 1: User Research.</h2>
          <p>After user interviews and heuristic evaluation, a few things were noticed about the old website..</p>
            <p>-Contrast ratio too low in header nav.</p>
            <p>-Breadcrumbs lacking</p>
            <p>-Hero image very large, prominent, but not CTA</p>
            <p>-A lot of content space being taken up by Icon Cards. Possible to economize space. The logos are too big</p>
            <p>-Text is too small and can be placed outside the image</p>
            <p>-The buttons are too similar to the body text</p>
            <p>-The footer needs to be more focused</p>
            <p>-Need a Search Bar</p>
            <p>-Need to fix the Donation button contrast</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3"> 
          <h2>PHASE 2: Definition and Synthesis</h2>
          <p>A problem was then defined:

            A mother needs to find a safe place for her four year old son who is living with developmental challenges amidst her and her partner’s hectic work schedule. How might we help her get access to the information on the services she needs for her son/daughter with developmental challenges?
            How might we help CWSDS gain brand awareness and more donor conversions by making the ‘donate’ user flow more visible and accessible?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3"> 
          <h2>PHASE 3: Ideation</h2>
          <p>We created a new sitemap and then formulated new wireframes. We created a fitting style guide that people with developmental disabilities might think is more 'fun' and attractive.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-3">
          <h2>PHASE 4: Prototyping.</h2>
          <p>Using the style guide and new sitemap, we created a more attractive version of the CWSDS website.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3"> 
          <h2>PHASE 5: User Testing</h2>
          <p>Five geurilla user tests were conducted. We received feedback that there was too much scrolling and that the 'Donate' button should also be on the Header for easier navigatioin. We iterated our prototypes based off of this feedback.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3"> 
          <h2>PHASE 6: Conclusion</h2>
          <p>In the future, we could spend more time experimenting with the UI tools. We spent more time on the details of designing than trying to use more UI elements. We should have also kept an UX journal of all the micro-decisions that we made.</p>
